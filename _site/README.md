# Jekyll Portfolio site
Portfolio playground made with Jekyll. This isn't my portfolio site but rather a project where I can play around with Jekyll documentation.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo or download the zip file. 
2. Run bundle install. If you don't have bundle installed, you will need to run the gem bundle install. 
3. Once bundle is installed, all you need to do is run jekyll serve. Go to localhost:4000 to see the site.

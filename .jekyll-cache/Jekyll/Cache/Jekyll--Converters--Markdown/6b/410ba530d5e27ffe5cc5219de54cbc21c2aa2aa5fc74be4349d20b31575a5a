        <p>Hello world! Iâ€™m Sarah and Iâ€™m a freelance front-end web developer from Canton, Ohio. I design, build, and edit WordPress websites for small businesses and creatives. I also work on various code related projects with React.js, Ruby, and Python.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m also a producer. I originally started blogging on The Original BritishPandaChick blog where I created the My Coding Journey series. I spent two years managing the BritishPandaChick Codes blog where I talked about coding, careers, and books. Today I manage Needlework Kits blogs where I talk about craft kits I make as well as write posts on The Practical Dev and Code Newbie. Iâ€™ve written content for other platforms including App Academy Book Prescriber.</p>
            
        <p>Before I started learning how to code, I spent 9 years teaching students academic skills at different schools in Stark County and at Sylvan Learning. Today I combined my coding skills and teaching background together to mentor new developers just getting started in tech. In April 2020, I taught a brown bag lesson to Lambda School students on how to use Bootstrap to create a portfolio website.</p>

        <p>I have completed two Skillcrush career blueprints where I learned how to code with JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, and WordPress. Recently I learned how to use Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to create web applications. Last year I learned how to use Node.js to build Alexa skills and learned how to use Sass to compile styles on a website. I love learning and Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Ruby on Rails to create web applications.</p>

        <p>When I am not writing code or blogging, I serve as the moderator for the Elphas Can Code online community on Elpha. In July 2019, I created the Disney Codes Challenge in order to help developers develop the habit of building more projects. I also mentor new developers in my spare time by providing support and empowering developers as they continue to code. In 2020, I became an VIP expert on Fairy God Boss and started sharing advice to help job seekers with their careers.</p>

                <h3>WordPress Web Design</h3>
                <p>Do you want to convert a specific look into a live page on the web? I translate designs into WordPress websites. All you need to do is send your design and Iâ€™ll turn that design into a website. If you donâ€™t have a design, Iâ€™ve got your back. We will work together to put together the perfect design that has everything you need for your site.</p>
                <p><em>What you need</em>: domain, hosting, and content (i.e. images, copy)</p>

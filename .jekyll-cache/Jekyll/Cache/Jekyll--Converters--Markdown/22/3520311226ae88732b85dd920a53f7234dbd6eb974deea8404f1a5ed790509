        <p>Occupied in observing Mr. Bingleyâ€™s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.</p>

        <p>I have completed two Skillcrush career blueprints where I learned how to code with JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, and WordPress. Recently I learned how to use Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to create web applications. Last year I learned how to use Node.js to build Alexa skills and learned how to use Sass to compile styles on a website. I love learning and Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Ruby on Rails to create web applications.</p>

        <p>When I am not writing code or blogging, I serve as the moderator for the Elphas Can Code online community on Elpha. In July 2019, I created the Disney Codes Challenge in order to help developers develop the habit of building more projects. I also mentor new developers in my spare time by providing support and empowering developers as they continue to code. In 2020, I became an VIP expert on Fairy God Boss and started sharing advice to help job seekers with their careers.</p>
